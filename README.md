# Botly
![Botly Logo](https://github.com/Team-Nope/Botly/blob/master/src/images/logo.png)

The open-source Visual-Based Development Interface for creating bots. Made on top of functions from Discord.JS. Online Prototype: [Botly](https://botly-56339.web.app)

# How to use
To add a block to your program, you can just drag and drop the corresponding blocks. On hovering over the block, you can see a description of the use cases of the block. If you right-click, you will be able to colapse/expand/disable blocks. All your code must be inside the original setup block, and will cause an error on compile if done otherwise. The code is auto-generated at the bottom. 

# Once you have created your bot, do the following:
1) Install [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2) Click Download on the site you made your bot on. You have downloaded your bot.
3) Extract the files you just downloaded
4) Coy the path to the folder you just extracted
5) In your command line, type
  ```
  cd *Path/To/Bot*
  npm install
  node index
  ```
